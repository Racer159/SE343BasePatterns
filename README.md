# SE343BasePatterns
## Overview
The purpose of this exercise is to acclimate you with Fowler's "Base Patterns".  As a team, you will develop running code examples of the following patterns, along with a short write-up for each about when/where they would be used and why. (Do not copy off the web). The code examples can be short snippets for each, but should be very clear what each does. Do your best to make them runnable on the lab machines, but ask your instructor if you run into any issues. You may use any language you desire.
## Implementation
Each of these patterns falls under its own subfolder and is implemented using python3.  Below is the categorization of the difficulty of each as easy (E), medium (M), and hard (H).

* Gateway - E 
* Mapper - E
* Layer Supertype - E
* Seperate Interface - E
* Registry - M
* Value Object - M
* Special Case - M
* Plugin - H
* Service Stub - E
* Record Set - M
